### Freshman21 is a Jekyll theme.

A tribute to Twenty Twelve and Twenty eleven.

I like wordpress's theme Twenty Twelve and Twenty eleven very much. 
So I called my Jekyll theme Freshman21 (Freshman <q>twenty-first</q> , it means twenty-first century, not twenty-one), this theme is based on my former theme [Freshman](https://github.com/yulijia/freshman/).

Freshman21 have two main page format, one is [single column](http://yulijia.net/en/  "see demo"), the other is two columns. For more details, please see the articles on the site.

<cite>Proudly enjoy using Freshman21 theme.</cite> <code>;)</code>
